# COVIDHack

Dear _Legal Hackers_ and Community,

As an international community of civic-minded lawyers, technologists, designers, and policy-makers, we have a unique opportunity to produce a global resource for communities impacted by the COVID-19 virus.

We have created and will focus our attention on this GitHub repository called [COVIDHack](https://github.com/GlobalPolicyLH/COVIDHack) to serve as a central compendium of information about how different jurisdictions are responding to the outbreak, from different perspectives: (i) policies; (ii) incentives and grants; (iii) education and information; (iv) entrepreneurship.

We ask that people use this [linked Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTJMmHlG07MJ8miqC_RaGwzrAYL9rlmGrVWz3W38dvcq06qg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit initial information in a structured fashion from your respective cities/countries to include the following:

## I. Policies
  * Government COVID-19 policies
  * Government contact information

## II. Incentives and Grant
  * Governmental incentives and grants 

## III. Education and Information
  * Government advice resources
  * Reliable news/updates

## IV. Entrepreneurship
  * Tech innovations to relieve and fight the pandemic 
  * The impact of the pandemic on the global innovation arbitrage

We recognize the value in collecting as much information as we can in this time of crisis and have created a second, public-facing version of the form that you can share with people outside the LH community.  

We believe the strength, capillarity and ethos of the Legal Hackers community may positively contribute to create an open and shared learning mechanism that may, ultimately, contribute in this moment of global pandemics.
