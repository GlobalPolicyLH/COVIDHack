# COVIDHack

Dear Legal Hackers and Community,

As an international community of civic-minded lawyers, technologists, designers, and policy-makers, we have a unique opportunity to produce a global resource for communities impacted by the COVID-19 virus.

We have created this GitHub repository called COVIDHack to serve as a central compendium of information about how different jurisdictions are responding to the outbreak, from different perspectives: (i) policies; (ii) incentives and grants; (iii) education and information; (iv) entrepreneurship.

We will forward Google form to submit information from your respective cities/countries to include the following:

*1. Policies*

(i) Government COVID-19 policies

(ii) Government contact information

*2. Incentives and Grants*

(i) Governmental incentives and grants 

*3. Education and Information*

(i) Government advice resources

(ii) Reliable news/updates

*4. Entrepreneurship*

(i) Tech innovations to relieve and fight the pandemic 

We believe the strength, capillarity and ethos of the Legal Hackers community may positively contribute to create an open and shared learning mechanism that may, ultimately, contribute in this moment of global pandemics.
